Parallel Primes Project

This is the first project for operating systems.

This program counts the number of prime numbers in a specified range.

Some useful information. For a C to vs code install guide go here https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-and-run-c-cpp-code-on-visual-studio-code/ 

To run code do gcc -o filename filename.c
After this on windows type filename 
On linux type ./filename

Keep in mind file name means the filename without the .c extension
